# PowerPoint MIDI Presenter Add-on
A simple PowerPoint Add-On to change slides based on MIDI CC events

This is in an early prototype stage with MIDI polling and slide tagging but no event assignments.  

The following has to be done to leave prototype:
- [ ] Ribbon Bar Global Presentation Settings for MIDI channel and device assignment
- [ ] Ribbon Bar Global Presentation Settings for Section and Slide navigation
- [ ] Ribbon Bar and/or Action Pane for active slide MIDI settings 
- [ ] Slide Tag Interogation
- [ ] Song Part UI Tag Editor
- [ ] Ribbon Bar Global setting to toggle the add-in events on or off so that new presentations are not automatically interrogated or modified
